#Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project

##Project Introduction
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and can be download from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), and a full description is available at the site where the data was obtained from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

##Project Tasks
The task of the project is to create tidy data based on the original data, which can be used later for other analysis. Create a R script to perform the following steps in order to deliever the tidy data which meets the requirement. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
4) a readme file namely README.md explaining how to run the script, what it does and how it works
