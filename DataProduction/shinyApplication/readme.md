# Random Sampling 

## Introduction
Drawing random numbers from a probability distribution are commonly used, and the distribution of the random numbers drawed depending on the number of samples. In this application, playing with different probability distributions, we can check the distribution of the random numbers. 

## Instruction
The application takes inputs which are: the number of samples (integer), random seed (integer), mean and standard deviation of a distribution selected in the check box.

There are three distributions are included: 
1. Normal distribution 
2. Log-normal distribution 
3. Poisson distribution 
At the end the number of bins shown in the histogram is set. The default settings are 100 samples with 333 as the seed, standard normal distribution N(0,1), and 10 bins in the histogram. The user can change those default values according to their needs, and by clicking "Update", the figure on the right will updated to show the comparison.

The main panel is consist of a output to indicate the distribution name, and a figure panel that shows the comparison of the random number histogram (density) and the probability density function from which random numbers are picked.
